## I found a security issue

We take security very seriously. If you discover a security issue or think you found one, please bring it to the maintainers attention.

Please send your findings to hello@amazee.io. Please **DO NOT** file a GitHub issue for them.

Security reports are greatly appreciated and will receive public Karma and Swag! We're also working on a Bug Bounty system.
