# lagoon Command Line Interface

## Installation

Install the CLI with either `npm` or `yarn`.

```sh
# Either npm...
npm install --global @lagoon/cli

# ...or Yarn
yarn global add @lagoon/cli
```

## Setup

The CLI needs a configuration file at `<project directory>/.lagoon.yml`, which can be created with [the `init` command](#lagoon-init):

```sh
# Initialize project configuration
lagoon init
```

For more options, see the [`lagoon init` documentation](#lagoon-init).

```

#### `lagoon login` Examples

By default, the login command uses the SSH private key at `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`.

```text
$ lagoon login
Login successful
Done in 1.28s.
```

If that file does not exist, the user will be prompted for the path:

```text
$ lagoon login
? Path to private key file /path/to/id_rsa
Login successful
Done in 3.42s.
```

The path to the key can be also passed in via the `--identity` option (short form `-i`):

```text
$ lagoon login -i /path/to/id_rsa
Login successful
Done in 1.70s.
```

If the private key has a passphrase, the user will be prompted to enter it. The passphrase will never be saved.

```text
$ lagoon login -i /path/to/id_rsa
? Private key passphrase (never saved) [hidden]
Login successful
Done in 4.15s.
```

## Development - local nodejs

The `execute <cli command>`, `sshlogin` and `sshlogout` yarn scripts can be used to run CLI commands during development.

## Development - inside docker

There is already a docker container prepared that has the cli running. Run a new container with bash and then run `yarn run execute <command>`

```sh
docker-compose run --rm cli bash
```
