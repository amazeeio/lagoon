## MariaDB Drupal image
Lagoon `mariadb-drupal` Docker image, is a customized `mariadb` image to use within Drupal projects in Lagoon.  
It differs from `mariadb` only for initial database setup, made by some environment variables:

| Environment Variable              | Default             | Description                                    |
| ---------------------------------      | ---------      | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `MARIADB_DATABASE`                     |   drupal 	    | Drupal database created at startup             |
| `MARIADB_USER`                         |   drupal 	    | Default user created at startup                |
| `MARIADB_PASSWORD`                     |   drupal 	    | Password of default user createt at startup    |
