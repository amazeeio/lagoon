# Solr Image
Lagoon `Solr` image Dockerfile, based on the offical `solr:<version>-alpine` images.  
The supported versions of Solr on Lagoon are 5.5, 6.6 and 7.5.  

This Dockerfile is intended to be used to setup a standalone Solr server with an initial core `mycore`.

## Lagoon & OpenShift adaptions
This image is prepared to be used on Lagoon which leverages OpenShift. There are therefore some things already done:

- Folder permissions are automatically adapted with [`fix-permissions`](https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container/blob/master/core/root/usr/bin/fix-permissions) so this image will work with a random user and therefore also on OpenShift.
- `10-solr-port.sh` script to fix and check Solr port.
- `20-solr-datadir.sh` script to check if Solr config is compliant for Lagoon.

## Supported version
Lagoon supports Solr versions: `5.5`, `6.6`, `7.5`
