# amazee.io API

The amazee.io API for the amazee.io infrastructure.

## URLs

### develop branch:

- http://api-develop.appuio.amazeeio.review/ - uses the production hiera (https://git.vshn.net/amazee/amazee_hieradata branch master)
- http://api-develop-testhiera.appuio.amazeeio.review/ - uses the testhiera (https://github.com/amazeeio/api-test-hiera branch master)

### master branch

- https://api.amazeeio.cloud

## Local development with Docker

As the API is hosted within Docker, Docker can also be used for development.
This means there is no need to have Node.js, Yarn or any development dependency locally
installed. All you need is Docker and Docker Compose (included in Docker for Mac).

### Installation

```sh
# Install Docker for Mac
brew cask install docker

# Then open Docker for Mac to finish the installation
```

For our unit-tests, we require the test-api-hiera git submodule to be initialized.

```
# Install submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Usage

Run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

and this will build the Docker image (takes a bit) and start the API and
authentication services in development mode (e.g. `yarn run dev` in case
of the API).

Run a service in production mode (e.g. the API server):

```sh
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports api yarn run start
```

Unfortunately this does not give a lot of flexibility. So you might just open
a bash to the Docker Container and run yarn commands directly:

```sh
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports api bash
```

Now you are inside the Docker container and can run any commands like:

```sh
yarn run build
yarn run start
```

Similar results can be achieved with the other services.

### How to use Redux Dev Tools

To be able to successfully use redux-dev-tools, we are required to
forward all redux events to a `remotedev-server`, which acts as a
proxy between the Chrome redux-dev-tools plugin and the api redux
store.

Since there is extra overhead on the startup, the connection to the
remotedev-server is turned off by default.

Make sure to set the environment variable `REMOTE_DEV_SERVER=true` for
the api service in your `docker-compose.yaml` and also make sure to
run the `remotedev` docker service:

```
docker-compose up api auth-ssh auth-server auth-database remotedev
```

Next, make sure to have the [Chrome redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
installed.

As soon all services are running and all extensions are installed, execute following steps:

1. Open Chrome, enter `localhost:9090`, this will open the redux-dev-tools connected to `remotedev:9090`
2. Make a change to the api source code, so the server restarts, this will make sure the connection is established
3. Now you should be able to use redux-dev-tools and see a list of actions & the current state tree

## Local Development without Docker (node and yarn installed on your machine)

### Installation

In order to run or work with this project you need to first install all Node
packages via Yarn. Make sure that you have both, Node and Yarn installed. I highly
recommend using Node Version Manager (NVM).

To install the packages required for this project, run `yarn install` in the
project directory.

Additionally, you need to copy the *.env.example* file to *.env* and edit it
according to your environment.

If you are using OSX, you will probably need to install `libgcrypt` and
`openssl` via `brew`:

        brew install libgcrypt
        brew install openssl

### Running the server

To run the server in development mode, simply run `yarn run dev` in the project
directory.

To run the server in production mode, you first need to build the project by
running `yarn run build`. Now, you can start the server by running `yarn run
start`.

### Remarks

Only the `/src` folder and `package.json`, `yarn.lock` folders are mounted from
the host into the docker containers. We do that so that changes in your IDE are
immediately available within the docker container and do not need a rebuild or
restart of such. But we cannot mount the `node_modules` folder as some of the
dependencies need to be built on the operating system directly. As the container
is running centos linux and your host probably is different, we need to build
them on the host directly. So if you change something with the dependencies you
need to either rebuild the image via `docker-compose build api` or just connect
to the container and run `yarn install` (you need to do that though every time
you reconnect again, until you build a new image).

Also the `.env` file is only checked when you actually run `docker-compose build`,
so the best is to just edit the `environment:` key in docker-compose.yaml, which
will create real environment variables and will be also recreated every time you
use `docker-compose run`
