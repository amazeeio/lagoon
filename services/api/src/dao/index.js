// @flow

// ATTENTION:
// The `sqlClient` part is usually curried in our application
// This file exposes a make function to easily interact with
// our data access functions.

// The logic is split by domain model, that means that each
// domain model has its own module / file.

// We now use knex as our SQL query builder.
//
// Obsolete former notice:
//
// A WORD ABOUT DB SECURITY:
// ---
// We are heavily relying on building manual SQL strings,
// so of course, there is a certain risk of SQL injections.
// We try to tackle this issue by using prepared statements and
// input validation via GraphQL schema.
//
// So whenever you are writing new functions, ask yourself:
// - Am I passing in unvalidated input?
// - Is the user capable of injecting sql code via the cred object?
// - Even as an api developer, is it possible to pass in malicious SQL code?
//
// We will progressively iterate on security here, there are multiple
// ways to make this module more secure, e.g.:
// - Create higher order validation functions for args / cred and
//   apply those to the later exported daoFns
// - Use a sql-string builder, additionally with our prepared statements.
//   Currently we are playing around with `knex` as our sql-builder library
