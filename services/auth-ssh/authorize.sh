##### START ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION

# TODO: This is a super dirty hack. Directly printing the output into
# stdout, however, doesn't work. I have no fucking clue and this is
# super weird.
#
# Even with the solution below (the hack) we get random login failures
# here and there. Someone with better bash and debugging skills than me
# needs to take a look.
#
# The following code does not work:

# while read -r key; do
#   printf "$key\n"
# done <<< "$keys"

##### END ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION
##### START HACKY TEMPORARY SOLUTION

# Empty the keys file or create it.
